# Calculator

Serve index.html locally via a web server like Live Server in VS Code or a Python web server.

TODOs:
1) Bug fix where pressing multiple operators after an operand is pressed causes the next result to be incorrect after another operator is pressed
~~Bug fix where pressing multiple operands after an operator is pressed does not display in both displays properly~~
~~Bug fix where pressing the same operand after an operator equals the operand and, when other operands are then pressed, only that value is appended to the expression display and the main display value stays that operand.~~
2) Add decimal button functionality
3) Refactor and clean up
4) Create unit tests for fun

If you want to experiment with Jest tests that manipulate the DOM, run `yarn` or `yarn install`.
