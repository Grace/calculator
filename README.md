# Calculator

Serve index.html locally via a web server like Live Server in VS Code or a Python web server.

TODOs:
1) Bug fix where pressing multiple operands after an operator is pressed does not display in both displays properly
2) Add decimal button functionality
3) Refactor and clean up
4) Create unit tests for fun

If you want to experiment with Jest tests that manipulate the DOM, run `yarn` or `yarn install`.
